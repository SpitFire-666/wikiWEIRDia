## A collection of interesting Wikipedia articles collected through the years

Scandals, Tragedies, Eccentric People, the Unexplained, Disappearances, Conspiracies, Coincidences, Murderers, Cannibals, Novelties, Superstitions, interesting Places, Theories, Hoaxes...

## History 📱

I decided to publish my personal list of wiki articles for the greater good after my misguided attempt at an Android app [wikiWEIRDia](). After wrangling Android Studio and Java, I had an app that worked, but little did I realise the real challenges lay within Google's convoluted and frustrating publishing hurdles for the Play Store.

Through sheer determination, the app was approved and listed, only to die a death-by-algorithm. Searching for its exact, unique name in the Play Store would instead show all kinds of random and unrelated apps, with my app way down the list.

|[Nazi gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_gold)|Nazi gold is gold possessed by Nazi Germany.

Because gold stores are often private, exact details of transactions and storage are difficult to precisely identify. Gold that was collected was stored at least in part in central depositories. The transfer of gold in return for currency took place in collusion with many individual collaborative institutions.
